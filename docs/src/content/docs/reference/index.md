This section contains the complete reference documentation for the AgentCore deploy adapter. These pages are information-oriented and designed to be consulted as needed, not read front to back.

- [Configuration Reference](/reference/configuration/) -- JSON Schema for the adapter's deploy config, including all fields, nested objects, validation rules, and error examples.
- [Resource Types](/reference/resource-types/) -- Every resource type the adapter manages, including AWS API calls, lifecycle support, health check behavior, and status values.
- [Environment Variables](/reference/environment-variables/) -- All `PROMPTPACK_*` environment variables injected into AgentCore runtimes, with sources, conditions, and example payloads.
