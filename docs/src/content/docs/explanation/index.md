The explanation pages discuss the concepts, tradeoffs, and design decisions behind the AgentCore deploy adapter. They are intended to help you build a mental model of how the adapter works and why it behaves the way it does.

- [Security Model](./security/) -- IAM roles, Cedar policy generation, A2A authentication, resource tagging, and config diagnostics.
